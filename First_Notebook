Note: \n","Each Jupyter notebook is a collection of cells. A cell is a container for text to be displayed in the notebook or code to be executed by the notebook's kernel. Cells form the body of a notebook. There are two types of cells in a notebook. The first one is the “Code” type. A code cell contains code to be executed in the kernel and displays its output below. The second one is the “Markdown” type. A Markdown cell contains text formatted using Markdown and displays its output in-place when it is run.
